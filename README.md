# File Scanner and Analyzer

This Python script allows you to select a folder and it will scan all the files within it (including subfolders)

It calculates the total size of all files and provides a breakdown of the file extensions found within the selected folder and sorts them by the count of extension they occupy.


## How to Use

1.  **Save the script:** Download the Python file
2.  **Run the script:** Simply run the script by double clicking it
3.  **Select the folder** After you run the script, the script will ask you to select the folder that you want to scan

Voila! üêà
